<header><h1>statement about the girl</h1></header>
	  
<p>Flipping through boxes of old family photographs, I came across a fantastic visual to illustrate my lifelong frame of mind.  Because it embodied my recollection of childhood, I removed it from the carefully catalogued file of years and stuck the photograph under my mother's nose. I was in a frenzy.  Here was proof of the early death of my innocence.</p>
<blockquote>"What?" she noted sweetly, "you were having fun."</blockquote>
<p>It's just less than three by five inches with the classic round edges of early Kodak. The muddy water of the Atlantic Ocean is tumbling as oncoming waves. Perfectly centered in the lapping foam is a face - eyes tightly shut, baby blonde hair plastered to forehead, a grimace. The angle of the head suggests the body is on its stomach, legs flailing out of control with arms rigidly waving in front. The grimace says fight.<p/>

</p>It is the ageless drama on dated color film. Sink or swim. The struggle to stay afloat while the tsunami of life crashes on top of you, dragging you under, pulling you back.Sand in your pants. And loved ones document it, citing prosperity, nostalgia, and good summer fun.</p>
<p>Though perhaps the grimace is a joyful squeal. Cool water on hot skin and the adrenaline of keeping your head held high. The thrill of feeling your own strength and that baby step toward independence. And loved ones document it, citing prosperity, nostalgia, and good summer fun.</p>
</p>I showed this photograph to everyone, proudly displaying the potential suffering of growing up. No one questioned the fear on my young face, captured so long ago. Even my mother admitted it looks as though I may have been scared, but who can know panic from pleasure? The strength of the image is in its ambiguity, its ability to intend delight yet suggest horror.</p>
<p>One last time I picked up this object, this snapshot that instantly captured my enduring obsession with my misery and that tragic feeling I was born with my glass half empty.  And for the first time, I turned this image over. It read: Shawn, Seaside Heights, 1982.</p>
<blockquote>It is my brother.</blockquote>
<p>When I acknowledged my discovery (and disappointment) to my mom, she suggested, "Well, it could have been you."</p>  
<p>Could have been.</p>  
<p>That darling photo that served my memory, pride, and artistic vision was not my own.</p>
<p><em>Nostalgie de la boue</em> is French, though it is an American invention given a romantic tongue. <a href="http://nostalgia-for-mud.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Nostalgia for Mud</a>. Transliterated, it expresses a longing for the gutter, the obsession with self-degradation, the lowly, the primitive.  It is the swan that wishes for the life of a duck. I find it not only relevant that my response to the photograph confirms that I am such a swan, but that I spent my youth playing in the mud. I was the digger who filled the backyard with holes. I would find a dead bug and show it to my mom. 
<blockquote>"Oh," she'd remark, "it's dead, but isn't it pretty?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>Yes, pretty.</blockquote>

<header><h1>statement about the work</h1></header>
<p>(sigh). It is how I breathe. People often mistake my heavy exhaling for sadness and stress. But it's inhaling deeply, refreshing my lungs while slowing my thoughts to a more perceptive pace. It happens often now; satisfaction as pieces fit a puzzle.</p>
<p>My work offers me two sanctuaries. The processes I apply to create my work involve mostly small, repetitive gestures such as knitting, stitching, and stuffing. This generates a meditative space where my worries are subverted. Plush toys, the silent friends of my youth, carefully undone, seam by seam, are made ready for preservation.</p>

Plush toys are also vacuum-sealed, literally stopping the toy's deterioration, carrying on its timeless tribute to childhood, yet crumpling each toy into an unrecognizable formlessness. This process of deconstruction is again employed to unravel baby blankets, compressing them into solid forms, resulting in new energies that embody tension and stability simultaneously. I also reconstruct, creating creatures derived from children's drawings. Each creature is given a name because, like each of us, it embodies joy and fear, excitement and anxiety, and therefore becomes real.</p>
<p>These new forms have lost the comfortable familiarity of childhood imagination. In deconstruction and re-assemblage, objects lose ownership of their memories; therefore, it is appropriate that the materials I use are not mine. I collect the remnants of other children's play, searching flea markers and thrift stores, thereby accumulating the residue of experiences that can only be projected.</p>
<p>In many regards, each work is not a finished piece, but a stone in the walkway of reconciliation. As I come to terms with my self-imposed penance, my false memories, and a comfort in my sadness, my work reflects the ordered chaos and the meditative joy in destroying. An unraveling that should not be taken literally. Disassembling, hoping to find heartbeat in plush. Distortion that results from holding on forever. These are methods I employ to re-experience the despondency of the past as a means of finding comfort in the present.</p>
<p>In this way, my sighs are pacified.</p>
